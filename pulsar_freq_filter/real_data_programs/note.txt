The conversion of the raw pulsar TOA data files into pulsar angular frequency
files is done by the programs in the "make_freq_files" directory

The slurm scripts in real_data_run run the Kalman filter and nested sampler method 
on the frequency data to get a posterior distribution for the model parameters. 
slurm_test_01.sh tests the one-component model.
slurm_test_02.sh tests the two-component model.

The programs that are called to do the tests are contained in the "programs" directory.

Order to run things in to get basic results:
Go to make_freq_files directory
Run test_script_01.sh
Go to real_data_run directory
Create directories ./outdir01/ and ./outdir02/
Run slurm_test_01.sh and slurm_test_02.sh
Done
