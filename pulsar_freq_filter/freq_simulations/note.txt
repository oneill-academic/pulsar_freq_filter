test01_R_noise_size_test tests the ability of the Kalman filter method to
recover the model parameters with varying levels of measurement noise in the
data.

test02_R_noise_vary_test tests the ability of the Kalman filter to use an EFAC 
parameter to correct for an incorrect measurement error given to the Kalman
filter.
