These four scripts each simulate 200 pulsar frequency time series. They then 
run the Kalman filter and nested sampler method on the data to get a posterior 
distribution for the model parameters. Each of the 4 scripts has a different 
level of measurement noise, which is controlled by the parameter R_in.
slurm_test_01.sh has R_in = 1e-30
slurm_test_02.sh has R_in = 1e-24
slurm_test_03.sh has R_in = 1e-20
slurm_test_04.sh has R_in = 1e-16.

The programs that are called to do the simulations are contained in the "programs" directory.
The programs in  "in_out_plots" and "pp_plots" can be used to assess the results of the simulations.

Order to run things in to get basic results:
Create directories ./outdir01/, ./outdir02/, ./outdir03/ and ./outdir04/
Run slurm_test_01.sh, slurm_test_02.sh, slurm_test_03.sh and slurm_test_04.sh
Change directory to ./in_out_plots/
Run analyse_modes_ll_noload.sh
Done
