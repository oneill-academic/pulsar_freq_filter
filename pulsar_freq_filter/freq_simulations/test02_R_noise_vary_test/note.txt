These two scripts each simulate 200 pulsar frequency time series. They 
then run the Kalman filter and nested sampler method on the data to get 
a posterior distribution for the model parameters. 

The programs in this directory simulate measurement noise with variance R_in 
and the Kalman filter used in the parameter estimation assumes a measurement
noise variance of R_out. Each of the scripts has different values for R_in 
and R_out. 
slurm_test_01.sh has R_in = 1e-27, R_out = 1e-23
slurm_test_02.sh has R_in = 1e-23, R_out = 1e-27.
An empty output directory must be created before running each of these 
programs to store the output.

The programs that are called to do the simulations are contained in the 
"programs" directory. The programs in "in_out_plots" and "pp_plots" can be 
used to assess the results of the simulations.

Order to run things in to get basic results:
Create directories ./outdir01/ and ./outdir02/
Run slurm_test_01.sh and slurm_test_02.sh
Change directory to ./in_out_plots/
Run analyse_modes_ll_noload.sh
Done
