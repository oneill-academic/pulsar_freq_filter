The script slurm_test_01.sh simulates 200 sets of simulated TOAs with random 
spacing. It then fits frequencies to the TOAs using TEMPO2. It then runs the 
Kalman filter and nested sampler method on the data to get a posterior 
distribution for the model parameters. The Kalman filter is also run on the 
true frequencies that were generated during the simulation of the TOAs as a 
comparison.

The programs that are called to do the simulations are contained in the 
"programs" directory. The programs in "in_out_plots" and "pp_plots" can be 
used to assess the results of the simulations.

Order to run things in to get basic results:
Create directory ./outdir01/
Run slurm_test_01.sh
Change directory to ./in_out_plots/
Run analyse_modes_ll_noload.sh
Done
